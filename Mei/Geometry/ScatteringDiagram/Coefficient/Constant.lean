# Constant sections of the coefficient local system

If every wall label of a finite wall diagram fixes a coefficient, then the family taking this
value at every off-wall point is a section of `coefficientLocalSystem` over every open subset
of the regular locus, including opens meeting walls and walls on which the crossing factors
would otherwise act. Path transport is a product of labels and their inverses, so it fixes the
coefficient, and no consistency of the diagram is needed.

For a linear family of fixed coefficients this gives a linear map into the sections whose value
at each off-wall point is the family itself, uniquely determined by these values.
`FiniteWallDiagram.exists_forall_value_eq_iff_smul_eq` shows that for one wall the fixedness of
the label is also necessary. The wall-crossing transport follows Gross–Hacking–Siebert,
*Theta functions on varieties with effective anti-canonical class*, §3.2 (arXiv:1601.07081v4).
