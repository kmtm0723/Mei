# Dilations and germ labels along rays

The dilation `DirectedWall.Pushforward.dilation` by a positive rational `q` moves every support
`S` to `q • S` and keeps normals, rays and labels. It fixes a diagram whose supports are
invariant under rescaling (`DirectedDiagram.pushforward_dilation_eq_self`), for instance an input
of full hyperplanes through the origin. Since forming the scattering class commutes with
pushforward (`DirectedDiagram.pushforward_scat`), every representative `E` of the scattering class
of such a *central* input is equivalent to all its dilations
(`DirectedDiagram.equivalent_pushforward_dilation_of_toClass_eq_scat`). The germ label of the
dilation at `q • θ` is the germ label of `E` at `θ`
(`DirectedDiagram.germLabel_pushforward_dilation`).

The main result is that the germ label is constant along open rays in a linear hyperplane `A`
and is the same for all representatives. If `E` and `F` represent the scattering class of a
central input, `θ` is a generic point of `A` for `E`, and `t • θ`, `t > 0`, is a generic point of
`A` for `F`, then the germ labels of `F` at `t • θ` and of `E` at `θ` agree in every direction
outside the direction of `A` (`DirectedDiagram.germLabel_smul_eq_of_toClass_eq_scat`, from
`DirectedDiagram.germLabel_smul_eq_of_equivalent_dilation`).

So for a central input the *wall function on a ray* of its completion, in the sense of
Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich, *Canonical bases for cluster algebras*, §1.1 (arXiv:1411.1394v2),
is one element of the completed group, independent of the representative and of the generic
point on the ray. Burcroff–Lee–Mou, *Positivity of generalized cluster scattering diagrams*,
Theorem 9.5 (arXiv:2503.03719v1), compares these wall functions on `ℝ_{≤0}m°` for two lattices.
