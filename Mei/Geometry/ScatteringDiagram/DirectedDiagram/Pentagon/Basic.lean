# Consistency of the pentagon configuration

Let `ℓ₁, ℓ₂` be the real extensions of two integral normals `μ₁, μ₂`, neither of whose kernels
contains the other. A directed diagram is in *pentagon configuration*
(`DirectedDiagram.IsPentagonConfiguration`) when it has exactly three walls: the hyperplanes
`{ℓ₁ = 0}` and `{ℓ₂ = 0}`, cooriented by `μ₁` and `μ₂`, and the half-hyperplane
`{ℓ₁ + ℓ₂ = 0, ℓ₁ ≥ 0}`, cooriented by `μ₁ + μ₂`. Write `A`, `B` and `C` for their labels. If
they satisfy the pentagon relation `B A = A C B`, the diagram is consistent
(`DirectedDiagram.IsPentagonConfiguration.consistent`).

A pentagon configuration is a fan configuration with the single outgoing wall
`{ℓ₁ + ℓ₂ = 0, ℓ₁ ≥ 0}` (`DirectedDiagram.IsPentagonConfiguration.isFanConfiguration`), and its
consistency is the case of one outgoing wall of `DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration.consistent`.
Walls whose labels vanish at an order are allowed.

For dilogarithm labels the relation is the pentagon identity, and the configuration is the
consistent scattering diagram of type `A₂` (Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich, *Canonical bases for
cluster algebras*, §1.1, arXiv:1411.1394v2); see
`Mei.Geometry.ScatteringDiagram.Skew.Principal.Pentagon`.
