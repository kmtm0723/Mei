# Kernel corrections over a split extension

Let `π : ℒ → ℳ` be a fixed-degree graded Lie homomorphism with a graded Lie section `s`,
both preserving wall spaces. Consider a diagram consistent at order `k` whose walls are
either lifted along `s`, with arbitrary supports, or are full hyperplanes or have
logarithms homogeneous of degree at most `k`. If its image under `π` is consistent at
order `k + 1`, the diagram admits a finite outgoing extension consistent at that order.
Every added wall has a homogeneous logarithm in the kernel of `π`, so the image of the
extension under `π` adds only trivial labels.

Thus the quotient diagram is held fixed through the correction, and no support
hypothesis is imposed on the lifted walls. This is the one-order step of relative
completion over a split extension: it combines `LoopProjection.ofSplitting` with
`LoopProjection.exists_consistent_outgoing_extension`, then reads off kernel membership
from the projection-fixed correction logarithms using
`PositiveDegrees.projection_expToCompletion_eq_one_iff`.

/-- Over a split extension, a diagram consistent at order `k` whose quotient is consistent
at order `k + 1` admits a finite outgoing extension consistent at order `k + 1`. The
lifted walls may have arbitrary supports; the others are full hyperplanes or have
logarithms homogeneous of degree at most `k`. Every added wall is born exactly at the new
order with a homogeneous logarithm in the kernel of `π`, so its image under `π` is
trivial. The extension preserves all lower-order transport and retains every old wall. -/
