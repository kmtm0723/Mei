# Finite families of joint correction walls

At the next order after a consistent cutoff, the logarithm of every loop product
has only the newly retained degree. For sufficiently small loops at the joints
of the adapted complex, assemble one outgoing swept wall for each nonzero
homogeneous component. The index retains both the joint and the actual degree,
including when distinct indices produce coincident supports. It is finite, and
every wall is first active at exactly the correction order. At each joint, the
sum of the new wall logarithms is the negative of the original loop logarithm.

This combines `DirectedDiagram.exists_outgoingWall_joint_obstruction` with
homogeneity of the truncation kernel and `DirectSum.sum_support_decompose`.
It is the finite-family assembly in the degree induction of Mandel,
*Scattering diagrams, theta functions, and refined tropical curve counts*,
proof of Theorem 2.6. The loops are supplied as actual admissible paths; their
positive meridian orientation and the geometric identities needed for
consistency of the corrected diagram are separate requirements.
