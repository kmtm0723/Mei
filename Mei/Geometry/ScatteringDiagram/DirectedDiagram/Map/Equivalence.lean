# Coefficient maps on directed equivalence classes

Fixed-degree coefficient maps preserve finite-order and all-order equivalence of
directed diagrams. In particular, changing coefficients of a completion is
independent of its wall presentation. Labels may vanish under the map, so a path
admissible for the image need not be admissible for the original diagram.

These are the special case `DirectedWall.Pushforward.ofFixedDegree` of
`DirectedDiagram.LevelEquivalent.pushforward`, allowing the active supports to disappear.
