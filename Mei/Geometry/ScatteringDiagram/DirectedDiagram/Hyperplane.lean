# A single full hyperplane is consistent but not equivalent to the empty diagram

The finite-order transport of a directed diagram with one wall whose support is a full affine
hyperplane `{ℓ = c}`, `ℓ` the real extension of the wall normal, is
`θ ^ (side x - side y)`, where `θ` is the projected label and `side z` is one on `{ℓ > c}` and
zero otherwise. Every closed path has trivial transport, so the diagram is consistent at every
order. When the label is not the identity, the transport between points on the two sides is a
nonidentity element, whereas a diagram without walls has trivial transport. Hence the diagram is
not equivalent to any diagram without walls: consistency does not force a diagram to be
equivalent to the empty one.

The commutative hyperplane transport `Quiver.Path.wallPathProduct_eq_prod_of_hyperplanes` is
applied to the abelian group of integer powers of the label, which is mapped into the truncated
group by `zpowersHom`.
