# Adjoining directed wall families

`DirectedDiagram.append` adjoins a correction family to an existing diagram,
retaining the two index types separately even when supports coincide. Both
families may be infinite, provided that they are finitely active at each order.
Restriction to the left indices recovers the original diagram up to reindexing.

If the appended labels vanish at a cutoff, the appended diagram and the original
have equal products on all common paths and the same consistency at that cutoff.
The comparison also holds at every lower cutoff. Thus adjoining corrections of
birth order `k + 1` preserves the transport already constructed through order `k`.
No consistency or commutativity at higher orders is assumed.

The comparison uses `DirectedDiagram.levelEquivalent_restrict` to discard
invisible walls and `DirectedDiagram.Refinement.ofEquiv` to identify the retained
indices. These are the same restriction and reindexing comparisons used in
`DirectedDiagram.outgoingCompletion_unique`.
