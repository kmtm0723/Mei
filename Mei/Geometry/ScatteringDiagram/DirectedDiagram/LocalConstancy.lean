# Local constancy along regular wall germs

Near a regular point, moving tangentially to every incident wall preserves the
incident indexed walls and their combined crossing label. The crossing vector
is fixed, and no consistency hypothesis is needed. Repeated or overlapping
supports retain their indexed multiplicities.

The geometric input is `Mei.Convex.eventually_mem_iff_of_submodule_le_direction`.
The combined-label API then lets coefficient constructions use this local
constancy without choosing an enumeration of the incident walls.

In particular, near a regular point of an affine subspace `A` all of whose incident walls span
`A`, the nearby points of `A` lie on the same walls and have the same combined label
(`DirectedDiagram.eventually_nhdsWithin_combinedLabel_eq`).

/-- **Local constancy along an affine subspace.** Let `θ` be a point of the affine subspace `A`,
outside the singular support of the walls active at order `k`, such that every active wall
through `θ` has affine span `A`. Then the points of `A` near `θ` are outside that singular
support, lie on exactly the same active walls as `θ`, and have the same combined label as `θ`
in every direction. -/
