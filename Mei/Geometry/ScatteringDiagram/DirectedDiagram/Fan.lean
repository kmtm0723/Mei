# Consistency of rank-two fan configurations

Let `ℓ₁, ℓ₂` be the real extensions of two integral normals `μ₁, μ₂`, neither of whose kernels
contains the other. A directed diagram is in *fan configuration*
(`DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration`) when it has two walls `j₁, j₂`, the hyperplanes
`{ℓ₁ = 0}` and `{ℓ₂ = 0}` cooriented by `μ₁` and `μ₂`, and every other wall `j` is a
half-hyperplane `{ℓⱼ = 0, ℓ₁ ≥ 0}` whose normal has real extension `ℓⱼ = p ℓ₁ + q ℓ₂` with
`p, q > 0`. Up to exchanging the two hyperplanes, this is the shape of the consistent completion
of two initial hyperplane walls: the other walls are rays of the quadrant `{ℓ₁ ≥ 0, ℓ₂ ≤ 0}` of the
plane `(ℓ₁, ℓ₂)`, around the joint `{ℓ₁ = ℓ₂ = 0}`. Infinitely many walls are allowed, and several
walls may share a support.

Write `A`, `B` and `Cⱼ` for the labels at order `k`. Suppose the walls active at order `k` other
than `j₁, j₂` are listed without repetition by a list `l`, sorted so that on `{ℓ₁ > 0}` the
positive side of each wall contains that of every later wall (equivalently, the slopes `p / q`
weakly decrease), and that `B A = A (∏_{j ∈ l} Cⱼ) B`. The chamber function `fanTransport` is
`A^[ℓ₁ > 0] (∏_{j ∈ l} Cⱼ^[ℓ₁ > 0, ℓⱼ > 0]) B^[ℓ₂ > 0]`, where `X^[P]` is `X` if `P` holds and `1`
otherwise. It is locally constant off the active walls
(`DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration.eventually_fanTransport_eq`), and crossing a wall changes it
by the signed combined label of the crossing
(`DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration.eventually_inv_mul_eq_combinedLabel`). Hence every admissible
path from `x` to `y` has order-`k` product `(fanTransport y)⁻¹ * fanTransport x`
(`DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration.levelPathProduct_eq`), and the diagram is consistent at
order `k` (`DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration.levelConsistent`). If such a list exists at every
order, the diagram is consistent (`DirectedDiagram.IsFanConfiguration.consistent`).

The relation `B A = A (∏ Cⱼ) B` rewrites the product `B A` of the initial labels as a product
sorted by slope. Such rank-two factorizations are studied in Nakanishi, *Cluster algebras and
scattering diagrams, Part III*, §5 (arXiv:2111.00800v6), whose ordering convention is opposite to
the one used here. For the pentagon identity there is one outgoing wall, and the
configuration is the consistent scattering diagram of type `A₂` (Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich,
*Canonical bases for cluster algebras*, §1.1, arXiv:1411.1394v2); see
`Mei.Geometry.ScatteringDiagram.DirectedDiagram.Pentagon`. The consistency is derived from the
local criterion `DirectedDiagram.levelConsistent_of_local` applied to the chamber function.
