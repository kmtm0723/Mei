# Cutting directed walls by half-spaces

Let `W` be a directed wall and `μ` an integral functional with real extension `ℓ`. If some
support point `x` of `W` satisfies `a < ℓ x`, the cut `W.support ∩ {a ≤ ℓ}` is again the support
of a directed wall with the normal, ray and label of `W` (`DirectedWall.cutHalfspace`). It is a
rational-normal polyhedron, and it spans the same affine subspace as `W.support`, because it
contains a strictly feasible point (`AffineMap.affineSpan_inter_le_eq`). For example, cutting a
full affine hyperplane gives a half-hyperplane, and in the plane a half-line.

Incomingness asks that the support be preserved by the geometric degree direction
`v = i(ρ w)`. A cut of an incoming wall is incoming exactly when `μ(ρ w) ≥ 0`
(`DirectedWall.incoming_cutHalfspace_iff`). The condition is necessary for every cut, of an
incoming wall or not: when `μ(ρ w) < 0`, the ray in direction `v` from a strictly feasible point
leaves the half-space (`DirectedWall.nonneg_of_incoming_cutHalfspace`). In particular, whether
the cut of an incoming wall is incoming does not depend on the offset `a`.

The directed walls and their incomingness follow Mandel, *Scattering diagrams, theta functions,
and refined tropical curve counts*, Definition 2.2 and Remark 2.3 (arXiv:1503.06183v5), with
affine supports.
