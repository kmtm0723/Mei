# Incoming walls with affine supports

A directed wall with supported ray `w` is incoming when the geometric degree direction
`i(ρ w)` is a recession direction of its support. Two examples show what this definition does
and does not require. Both use the positive quadrant `P = ℕ²` of `ℤ²`
(`Module.Basis.positiveDegrees` of the standard basis), arbitrary wall spaces, and labels
anywhere in the relevant wall group.

* Take `ρ = id`, the plane `ℝ²` with lattice `ℤ²`, the ray `w = e₁` and the normal `m = e₂*`.
  The half-line `𝔡 = ℝ_{≥0} e₁` and its translate `𝔡 + 2e₁` are supports of incoming walls
  (`DirectedWall.Examples.horizontalHalfLine_incoming`), since translation does not change the
  recession cone. Yet `e₁ ∈ 𝔡` and `e₁ ∉ 𝔡 + 2e₁`
  (`DirectedWall.Examples.geometricDirection_mem_horizontalHalfLine_zero`,
  `DirectedWall.Examples.geometricDirection_notMem_horizontalHalfLine_two`). Incomingness is a
  condition on the recession cone of the support, not on whether the support contains the
  direction.
* Take `ρ(a, b) = a` to `ℤ`, with `ℝ` as the spatial space. The degree `(0, 1)` has zero
  geometric direction, so every wall on its ray is incoming
  (`DirectedWall.Examples.incoming_of_ray_eq_verticalRay`). This includes the walls whose support
  is the single point `{c}`, the hyperplanes of the normal `id : ℤ → ℤ`
  (`DirectedWall.Examples.pointWall_support`).

The walls are `DirectedWall.ofAffineHyperplane` and its half-space cuts
`DirectedWall.cutHalfspace`. The directed walls and their incomingness follow Mandel,
*Scattering diagrams, theta functions, and refined tropical curve counts*, Definition 2.2 and
Remark 2.3 (arXiv:1503.06183v5), with affine supports.
