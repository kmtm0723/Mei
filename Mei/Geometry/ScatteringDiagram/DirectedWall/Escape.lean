# Far translates miss outgoing walls

An outgoing wall lies in a linear half-space whose defining functional is
strictly positive in its positive geometric degree direction. Every compact
set, including a transverse path or the boundary of a rectangle, eventually
misses the wall under translation in that direction. The conclusion is uniform
over the compact set and holds for every actual degree on its supported ray.

This is the geometric escape step in the uniqueness argument of
Travis Mandel, *Scattering diagrams, theta functions, and refined tropical curve
counts*, Theorem 2.6, [arXiv:1503.06183](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06183).
It uses `Mei.Convex.exists_pos_bound_of_notMem_recessionCone` and the uniform
compact-escape theorem on the existing `DirectedWall.support` carrier.

Consequently, consider additive coefficients on finitely many directed walls, nonzero
only on outgoing walls whose rays carry a common degree `n`. If their signed crossing
sum vanishes around every admissible loop at a point, it vanishes along every
admissible path from that point.
This is `Quiver.Path.wallCrossingSum_eq_zero_of_notMem_recessionCone` for the geometric
direction of `n`: it vanishes on the normals of those walls and is not a recession
direction of their supports. Walls with zero coefficient are unrestricted.
