# Restriction of scalars for directed walls

Let `H` be directed wall spaces of a positively graded Lie algebra over a commutative
`ℚ`-algebra `R`, and let `K` be a smaller scalar ring. The restricted wall spaces
`H.restrictScalars K` have the same elements, and the scalar-restriction comparison
`PositiveDegrees.completedBCHRestrictScalarsEquiv` identifies the completed BCH groups and their
wall groups (`DirectedWallSpaces.mem_wallGroup_restrictScalars_iff`). Hence a directed wall for
`H` is a directed wall for the restricted wall spaces with the same normal, supported ray and
support (`DirectedWall.restrictScalars`), and conversely (`DirectedWall.ofRestrictScalars`);
the two constructions are mutually inverse.

This allows coefficient maps between different coefficient rings over a common base ring `K`.
A `K`-linear fixed-degree graded Lie homomorphism `f` between the restricted gradings of
algebras over `R` and over `S` that preserves the restricted wall spaces maps a wall for `H` to
a wall for the wall spaces `H'` over `S` (`DirectedWall.mapRestrictScalars`): restrict scalars,
apply the fixed-degree map `DirectedWall.map` and undo the restriction. The normal, supported
ray and support are retained, so incomingness and outgoingness are preserved.
