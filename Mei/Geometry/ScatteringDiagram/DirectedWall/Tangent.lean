# Tangent walls at a point of the support

At a point `x` of the support of a directed wall, the tangent wall replaces the support by
its tangent cone at `x`, a rational-normal cone with zero offset, and keeps the normal,
the supported ray and the label. Near `x` the wall and the translate of the tangent wall by
`x` have the same points. The tangent wall has the same spatial velocity. A wall which is
incoming stays incoming, while an outgoing wall may become incoming, as happens at a vertex
of a bounded support.

This is the wall-level step of passing from a diagram to the diagram of the walls through a
joint, whose supports are cones. No lattice rationality of `x` and no full-hyperplane
hypothesis is needed; the support may be bounded or have lineality.
