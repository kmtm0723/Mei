# The Lie algebra of a skew lattice datum

A rational skew lattice form gives a coefficient-valued alternating form on the
unfrozen lattice over every commutative rational algebra. Its skew Lie algebra
retains a free generator at every unfrozen exponent, including radical degrees.
The generic positive grading and abelian-ray instances apply to any positive
monoid on this lattice; no adapted basis or nondegeneracy is required.

The bracket convention is `[X_n, X_m] = {m,n} X_(n+m)`, as in
Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich, *Canonical bases for cluster algebras*, §1 and
Appendix B, arXiv:1411.1394v2. The construction specializes
`Mei.SkewLieAlgebra` rather than identifying generators with their possibly
nonfaithful Poisson action.
