# Positive principal coefficients

For a coefficient map `S →+* R`, an element of the completed principal coefficient
algebra `R[[Q_pr]]`, with its native positive-increment filtration, is positive with
respect to the image of `S[Q_pr]` exactly when every coefficient of every
character-and-positive-degree monomial `z^m t^n` lies in the image of `S`.
For coefficients `ℚ[A]` and the positive subsemiring `ℕ[A][Q_pr]` this says that
every monomial coefficient is a polynomial with natural-number coefficients, the
positivity notion for wall functions in Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich,
*Canonical bases for cluster algebras*, §1.1 (arXiv:1411.1394v2), and
Burcroff–Lee–Mou, *Positivity of generalized cluster scattering diagrams*, §8.1
(arXiv:2503.03719v1).

The criteria transfer `Mei.AlgFiltration.isPositive_principalCompletion_iff` and
its `ℕ[A]` form through the free-coordinate identification of the native filtration
with the powers of the ideal of variables (`principalCoefficientCompletionEquiv`),
using `Mei.AlgFiltration.isPositive_completionEquiv_iff`. The polynomial dictionary
matches the image of `S[Q_pr]` with the image of `S[M°][t]` because it is natural in
the scalar ring. In the coordinates of an adapted basis this reads positivity in
`ℚ[A][M°][[t_i]]`. Coefficient maps need not be injective, characters have
filtration order zero, and the skew form may be degenerate.

A scalar power series evaluated at a monomial `z^q` of nonzero unfrozen degree is positive
exactly when all of its coefficients lie in the image of `S`
(`isPositive_completedAeval_single_iff`); this needs no free coordinates. The coefficient of
`z^(i q)` is read at the order `i deg q`, where it survives.
