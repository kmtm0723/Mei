# Incoming-source constraints of rescaled complete types

One positive scale bound compares the full incoming-source condition of every
complete decorated type at a fixed cutoff, uniformly on bounded endpoint sets.
The comparison retains the original global source and each type's last
reconstructed point. It uses the tangent cone of the source's ray-admission
domain, which can contain bases outside the source itself.

At a center in the closure of an actual type domain, persistence of incoming
admission supplies the center condition. The rescaled source constraint is then
given explicitly by the tight source inequalities tangent to the incoming
direction. This includes tangential source-face degenerations, empty encounter
words, and degree changes invisible in the spatial projection.

These theorems compare the source constraint on the unbounded incoming tail;
other incidence and avoidance constraints remain separate. They do not assert
admissibility of boundary paths. The closed-chart interpretation follows

(arXiv:2205.07753v2).
