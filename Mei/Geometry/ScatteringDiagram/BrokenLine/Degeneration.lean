# Closed charts for the full decorated ray family

Every cutoff decorated type has a continuous extension of its geometric paths
from its valid endpoint domain to its closure. At a boundary endpoint the
extension is a finite affine ray on the negative half-line: encounters may
collapse, while selected closed-support incidences and the incoming polyhedral
source persist. The decoration and the entire degree and encounter history stay
attached to the type, even when geometric bends cancel.

The full cutoff family admits finitely many closed polyhedral endpoint charts
with proper endpoint and compact-open path maps. Their interiors partition each
valid type domain. This supplies degeneration charts, without asserting that
boundary paths are admissible or classifying their boundary events.

We combine `exists_cutoffDecoratedRay_polyhedralCharts`,
`closure_admissibleBackwardDomain_subset_weakBackwardDomain`, and
`backwardLimitRay`. The endpoint parameterization follows Carl–Pumperla–Siebert,
*A tropical view on Landau–Ginzburg models*, §4 (arXiv:2205.07753v2).
