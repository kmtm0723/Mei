# Linearity of cutoff decorated-ray evaluation

The weighted evaluation of the entire cutoff ray family is linear in its
incoming homogeneous coefficient. Individual ray fibers need not be additive:
whole decorations can cancel, and a scalar can kill a decoration. A common finite
inventory, independent of the coefficient, allows those zero weights to be kept
while taking sums of linear propagation maps. Its bound is the existing geometric
encounter bound, including encounters that preserve the degree.

`cutoffDecoratedEvaluationLinearMap` has the original actual-ray evaluation as
its value. It supplies linear branch totals for matching families and local
resolution identities, without finiteness assumptions on homogeneous modules.
For rational polyhedral data, one finite exceptional arrangement makes this
entire linear map locally constant, simultaneously for every input.
Countably many systems have a dense Gδ common generic locus, with a neighborhood
for each operator that works for all of its inputs.

The proof uses `CutoffDecoratedRay.length_le`,
`cutoffDecoratedEvaluation_def` and the linear maps `homogeneousHistory`.
Whole-component propagation follows Mandel, *Scattering diagrams, theta
functions, and refined tropical curve counts*, Definition 2.10 and
Proposition 2.13 (arXiv:1503.06183v5).
