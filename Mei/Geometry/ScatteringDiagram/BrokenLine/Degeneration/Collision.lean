# Collisions in closed decorated-ray charts

On the closure of a complete decorated type's valid endpoint domain, a collapsed
encounter interval is either terminal, putting the endpoint on a wall, or
internal, putting the limiting path in singular support. Thus a limiting path
whose endpoint misses the walls and whose encounters remain regular retains
strictly positive elapsed times.

The wall family used for this classification may differ from the encounter
alphabet. Each encounter support need only lie in a corresponding closed wall
with the prescribed normal and offset. This permits exact simultaneous-event
supports, which are usually not closed. All coefficient histories, source
conditions and avoidance conditions remain in the original type domain.

These results classify loss of strict time order; they do not classify every
boundary event or assert admissibility of every limiting path. We combine
`backwardTime_eq_zero_imp_terminal_or_singularSupport` with the existing
`CutoffDecoratedType.path`. The closed-family interpretation follows
