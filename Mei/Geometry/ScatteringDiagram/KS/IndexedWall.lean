# Indexed walls and abelian-ray presentations of KS diagrams

An indexed wall of a KS space is a rational codimension-one cone in the hyperplane `w⊥` of a
supported ray `w`, labelled by an element of the completed group of that ray. An indexed wall
presentation is a family of indexed walls only finitely many of whose labels survive each
degree cutoff. Repeated supports keep distinct indices, and supports need not form a complex.

Two indexed walls with the same affine span lie on the same supported ray, since the degree
lattice is free. When rays are abelian (`IsAbelianRays`) their labels therefore commute, so at
each cutoff the active walls of a presentation have a finite path product: all signed labels
crossed at one time are multiplied without choosing an order. This is the abelian-ray
description of scattering diagrams in Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich, *Canonical bases for
cluster algebras*, §1.1 (arXiv:1411.1394v2), in the KS setting of Bridgeland, *Scattering
diagrams, Hall algebras and stability conditions*, §§2–3 (arXiv:1603.00416v4).

The path products use `Quiver.Path.wallPathProduct`; ray uniqueness is
`KSSpace.eq_of_mem_rayDegrees_of_ker_normal_le` and commutation is
`PositiveDegrees.commute_of_mem_completedRaySubgroup`.
