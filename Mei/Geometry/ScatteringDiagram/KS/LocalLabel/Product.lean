# Recovering completed germs from homogeneous walls

At a point regular for every cutoff of a completed KS diagram with abelian rays,
the active homogeneous walls through the point multiply to the projection of its
completed local label. The product uses the actual indexed walls, including their
degree-dependent supports, rather than an independently chosen list of coefficients.
There is at most one incident wall of each degree. Every nonzero coefficient retained
at the cutoff occurs, and inactive walls contribute no factors. In particular,
the projection is the identity exactly when no active homogeneous wall contains
the point: distinct homogeneous degrees cannot cancel.

This recovers local labels from the homogeneous indexed presentation even when the
underlying complexes never stabilize. Consistency is unnecessary. The construction
uses `CompletedDiagram.homogeneousWall_label_eq_germLabel`, uniqueness of a wall
through a regular point, `PositiveDegrees.projection_eq_noncommProd_homogeneousFactor`
and `Finset.noncommProd_bij`.

The local description follows Gross–Hacking–Keel–Kontsevich, *Canonical bases for
cluster algebras*, §1.1 (arXiv:1411.1394v2), and Bridgeland, *Scattering diagrams,
Hall algebras and stability conditions*, Definition 2.3 and §§2–3
(arXiv:1603.00416v4).
