# Exhaustion of the focus-focus slab branches

In one developed chart, crossing the focus-focus slab preserves the horizontal
exponent. A finite ray whose bends lie on the slab and whose direction increments
preserve the horizontal component has constant horizontal velocity. If its
horizontal direction is nonzero, it meets the slab at most once. We derive this
bound from the bend conditions, rather than requiring a one-crossing itinerary.

For endpoints in the opposite chamber, the ray is the existing `slabBranch` with
its prescribed incoming and outgoing exponents. This identification concerns
geometry; coefficient propagation and chart identifications are additional conditions.

We use `FiniteAffineRay.support_bends_subset_singleton` and
`FocusFocus.slabBranch_unique`. The one-crossing description follows
Gross–Siebert, *An Invitation to Toric Degenerations*, §2.2–2.3
(arXiv:0808.2749v2), and Gross–Hacking–Siebert, *Theta functions on varieties with
effective anti-canonical class*, §3 (arXiv:1601.07081v4).
