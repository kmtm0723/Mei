# Exceptional arrangements from affine conditions

The zero sets of the nonconstant members of a finite family of affine functionals
form an exceptional arrangement. Constant conditions are omitted, including the
identically zero condition. When the affine conditions are continuous, all signs
are locally constant at a generic point. This turns finite continuous affine
inequalities into stable local membership tests, even when some inequalities
vanish identically.

We use Mathlib's affine-subspace preimages and the existing generic-locus and
open-sign-region APIs.
