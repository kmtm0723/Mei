# Limits of admissible incoming rays

The compact-open closure of an admissible backward family consists exactly of
the extended paths at endpoints in the closure of its full admissible domain.
These paths retain their endpoints, all selected closed-support incidences and
nonnegative elapsed times. Their incoming tails remain admitted by a
rational-normal polyhedral source. In particular, taking a limit does not lose
the incoming source even though its admission threshold can depend on the path.

The path family over the closed endpoint domain is proper. Each individual
limiting half-line is also proper when its incoming direction is nonzero,
even if several encounters collapse. Boundary paths need not avoid the walls
or singular sets, and are not asserted to be transverse realizations.

We use `backwardPath`, the local characterization of
`AdmissibleRayRealization`, `backwardPath_eventually_mem_iff`, and
`TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron.eventually_add_smul_mem`. Individual half-line
properness is supplied by `isProperMap_backwardPath_restrict_Iic`.
The backward parameterization is that of
Carl–Pumperla–Siebert, *A tropical view on Landau–Ginzburg models*, §4
(arXiv:2205.07753v2).
