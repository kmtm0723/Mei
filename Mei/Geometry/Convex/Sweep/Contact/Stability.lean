# Stability of open rays with prescribed boundary contacts

Wall avoidance on an open incoming half-line persists under continuous variation
when a boundary contact stays in the wall's supporting hyperplane and the velocity
there is transverse. Polyhedrality excludes contacts escaping to infinity. The
finite-segment counterpart is in `Mei.Geometry.Affine.Segment` and only needs a
closed wall.

These relative stability statements allow recorded encounters to remain on walls.
They complement the persistence of transverse interior contacts, and supply the
wall-avoidance part of closed endpoint-chart boundary analysis, following
Carl–Pumperla–Siebert, *A tropical view on Landau–Ginzburg models*, §4
(arXiv:2205.07753v2).
