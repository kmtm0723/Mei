# The complex of a polyhedron and its faces

A rational-normal polyhedron `P` is a cell of the complex `FinitePolyhedralComplex.ofPolyhedron`
whose cells are `P` and its nonempty exposed faces. No boundedness, salience or rationality of the
offsets is assumed, so `P` may be unbounded, have lineality, or be a point with irrational
coordinates.

The cells of the complex are exactly the nonempty exposed faces of `P`
(`FinitePolyhedralComplex.mem_cells_ofPolyhedron`), and for nonempty `P` its support is `P`
(`FinitePolyhedralComplex.support_ofPolyhedron`). For a polyhedron, exposed faces of exposed
faces are exposed faces, and the intersection of two faces is a face of each of them; this is
what makes the cells a complex. If `P` is a cell of a complex `C`, then the complex of `P` is a
subcomplex of `C` (`FinitePolyhedralComplex.isSubcomplex_ofPolyhedron`).
