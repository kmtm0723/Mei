# Complexes with a line and with a ray at a real offset

In the plane `ℝ²` with the standard lattice `ℤ²`, consider

* the line `H = {y = c}`. Its only nonempty exposed face is itself, so its complex has the single
  cell `H` (`mem_cells_ofPolyhedron_lineAtHeight_iff`), and this cell has nonzero lineality
  (`lineal_recessionCone_lineAtHeight_ne_bot`);
* the ray `r = {(x, 0) | a ≤ x}` with endpoint `(a, 0)` for an arbitrary real `a`, for instance
  `a = √2`. Its nonempty exposed faces are `r` and `{(a, 0)}`, so its complex has these two cells
  (`mem_cells_ofPolyhedron_rightRay_iff`), and the ray has trivial lineality
  (`lineal_recessionCone_rightRay`).

Both are complexes of rational-normal polyhedra: the normals are coordinate functionals, while
the offset `a` of the ray is not required to be rational. They are the complexes
`FinitePolyhedralComplex.ofPolyhedron` of the line and of the ray.
