# Isolating a regular wall crossing

Near a point on a wall outside singular support, an admissible segment meeting
that wall has exactly one crossing. Every sufficiently short segment through
the point in any transverse direction is admissible and realizes this crossing.
This isolates the individual factors of path products before comparing them
with endpoint transport.

The proof uses regular-wall uniqueness and the openness of segment avoidance
from `IsClosed.isOpen_setOf_lineMap_notMem`. Crossing lists are characterized
by `FinitePolyhedralComplex.orderedCrossings_eq_iff`.
