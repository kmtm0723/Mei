# Coefficient points avoiding countably many exceptional arrangements

On the regular locus of a finite polyhedral complex, off-wall coefficient points
remain dense after imposing any countable family of exceptional-arrangement
conditions. The existing simultaneous-arrangement density theorem is pulled
back to the open regular locus and intersected with the dense coefficient points.
This supplies a dense domain for extending geometrically defined coefficients
to an ambient transport sheaf.
