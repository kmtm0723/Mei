# Simultaneous wall events

An event records the nonempty set of all indexed walls through its point and a
crossing sign. Its support requires exactly that incidence set, retaining every
index of coincident walls. Choosing one incident wall supplies a normal and an
offset. Supports with the same incidence set and opposite signs coincide; the
normal velocity distinguishes their signed encounters.
Realizability records a regular point and a transverse velocity with the
prescribed event sign, independently of any labels assigned to the walls.

These events give a finite encounter alphabet for rays through a finite wall
family. Their supports are rational semilinear whenever the original supports
are. This uses finite Boolean closure of `IsRationalSemilinear`; grouping
simultaneous crossings follows `WallComplement.signedCrossingEvent`.
