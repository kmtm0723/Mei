# Regular limits of exact simultaneous events

An exact event support need not be closed: a limit can acquire additional wall
indices. For closed ambient walls this can happen only in singular support.
At a regular limit the entire incidence set persists, and the event support
agrees locally with any of its recorded walls. Thus replacing selected closed
walls by exact simultaneous events introduces no new regular boundary events.

The argument uses relative-interior neighborhoods and the equality of the
affine spans of walls meeting at a regular point. No polyhedral, codimension
or finite-dimensional hypothesis is needed. The simultaneous-event convention
is that of `WallEvent.support`, retaining coincident indexed walls separately.
