# Relative perturbation of finite polygonal graphs

A finite family of free vertices can be chosen in prescribed open sets so that
all segments involving a free vertex are admissible for a finite polyhedral
wall family. Prescribed fixed vertices remain unchanged. Consequently a finite
graph whose edges between fixed vertices are already admissible admits
arbitrarily small vertex perturbations making every edge admissible.

This supplies relative general position for the edges of a polygonal mesh:
its boundary vertices can be fixed while its interior vertices move. No
embedding or distinctness assumption is imposed on the vertex positions.
The construction iterates `WallComplement.exists_mem_open_admissible_spokes`.
