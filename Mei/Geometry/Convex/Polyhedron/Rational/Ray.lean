# Open ray encounters and eventual source admission

The base points whose open positive ray along a lattice vector meets a closed
rational-normal polyhedron form a locally closed rational-normal polyhedron.
The nonnegative sweep gives the weak conditions; rows increasing along the ray
must additionally be strictly negative at its base. This excludes intersections
occurring only at parameter zero, while retaining positive isolated intersections
and rays tangent to the support.

Eventual membership along any real direction has a closed rational-normal domain:
it is a nonnegative sweep for recession directions and empty otherwise.
In recession directions, only the inequalities constant along the ray remain.
These two results supply wall avoidance and source admission for unbounded incoming
segments.

The construction reuses `IsRationalNormalPolyhedron.negRay` and the active-inequality
perturbation theorem `AffineMap.exists_pos_smul_add_forall_le`, together with
`Convex.eventually_forall_notMem_of_notMem_recessionCone` for nonrecession directions.

/-- The base points of open positive rays along a lattice vector meeting a closed
rational-normal polyhedron form a locally closed rational-normal polyhedron.
This is the strict-parameter counterpart of `IsRationalNormalPolyhedron.negRay`.
The vector may be zero or tangent to the polyhedron, and the intersection may be
a single point. -/
