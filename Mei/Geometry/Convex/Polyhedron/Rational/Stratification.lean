# Common stratifications of rational semilinear domains

A finite collection of rational semilinear sets admits one finite rational-normal
affine arrangement whose sign cells determine membership in every set. Its nonempty
sign cells partition the whole space into locally closed convex polyhedra. Each
original set is a union of these strata, including its lower-dimensional pieces.

This simultaneous construction is useful for endpoint domains of finitely many
affine histories: the set of admitted history labels is constant on each stratum.
It combines the individual arrangements supplied by
`IsRationalSemilinear.exists_eq_biUnion_signCell`, using their dependent disjoint
union as a common row index. Offsets remain arbitrary real numbers.
