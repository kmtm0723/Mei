# Rational presentations of polyhedral faces

Making selected inequalities active preserves rational normals: retain the
original rows and add their negatives at the selected indices. This also
preserves rational offsets when they are present.

The active-constraint classification of convex extreme subsets therefore gives
actual rational presentations of all faces. The argument does not assume that
an independently chosen exposing functional is rational. Arbitrary real offsets,
unbounded polyhedra and lineality are allowed.
