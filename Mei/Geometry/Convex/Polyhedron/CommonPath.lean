# Common admissible paths for wall families

`CommonWallComplement W` consists of the points allowed for every family `W j`.
An edge is a segment admissible for each family separately. Thus a quiver path
records one vertex list, with an admissible realization in every family. No
transversality to intersections between different families is imposed.

Projection to a family preserves vertices, concatenation and reversal. For
countably many finite codimension-one polyhedral families, any two common
allowed points are joined by such a path with two edges. This applies
`dense_setOf_forall_admissiblePairs`, based on Mathlib's Baire theorem, to the
existing `WallComplement.AdmissibleSegment` predicates. More generally, any
nonempty finite list of interior vertices admits arbitrarily close common
admissible paths with the same number of vertices and fixed endpoints. If the
endpoints are free, they can also be moved off every wall while approximating
all the prescribed vertices.
