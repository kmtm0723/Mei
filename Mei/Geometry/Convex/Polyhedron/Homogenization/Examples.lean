# Empty presentations and homogenization

The inconsistent presentations `1 ≤ 0` and `x ≤ 0 ∧ 1 - x ≤ 0` have the same
empty carrier, but homogenizing their rows gives different cones. The first
gives the whole height-zero line; the second gives only the origin. The actual
homogenization, defined from the carrier, gives the origin in both cases.
