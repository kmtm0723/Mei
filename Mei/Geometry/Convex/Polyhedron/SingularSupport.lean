# Finite affine covers of polyhedral wall singularities

The singular support of a family is the union of its relative boundaries and
the intersections of members whose affine spans have different directions.
For a finite family of codimension-one polyhedra this actual set is covered by
finitely many affine subspaces of codimension at least two. Unbounded walls,
lineality and coincident or parallel supporting hyperplanes are allowed.
Continuous affine equivalences transport singular support, including under a
bijection of wall indices, by the intrinsic-frontier image theorem. Finitely
many closed walls in finite dimension have closed singular support.
Covering each closed wall by pieces with the same affine span can only enlarge
singular support; extra fine walls are allowed.
