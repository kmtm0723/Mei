# Faces of affine arrangements

Every nonempty convex extreme subset of a weak cell of a finite affine
arrangement is the closure of a realized strict zero-specialization. Thus the
finite family of closures of realized sign cells is closed under nonempty
convex extreme subsets. These are statements about continuous real affine rows;
no rationality assumption or bundled polyhedral-complex structure is introduced.
