# Grouping sorted lists by a key

A list whose elements are sorted by a key `τ` is the concatenation of its fibres
`l.filter (τ · = t)`, taken along any strictly increasing list `T` of keys containing
every value of `τ` on `l`. Elements with equal keys keep their relative order.

This is used to compare products of time-sorted enumerations of wall crossings with
products of their simultaneous crossing events.
