# Positivity of completed power series evaluations

Let `x` be an element of the first completed ideal that is positive for a subsemiring
`P`. A scalar power series whose coefficients all land in `P` evaluates at `x` to a
positive element: at order `k` the evaluation is a finite sum of coefficient multiples of
powers of a representative in `P`. In particular every power series with natural-number
coefficients, such as a geometric series `∑ xʲ` or a power `(1 + x) ^ s`, evaluates
to a positive element, although such a series need not be the canonical image of an
element of `P`.
