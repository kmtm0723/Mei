# Commutativity of filtered completions

If all elements of a filtered ring commute, then so do all elements of its completion: each
finite-order projection lands in a quotient of the original ring, and elements of the
completion are determined by their projections. This applies to rings whose multiplication
is commutative but which carry only a `Ring` structure, such as subalgebras of twisted
monoid algebras at a trivial factor set.
