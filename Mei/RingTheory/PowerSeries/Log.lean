# Coefficient naturality of formal logarithms

The formal logarithm of a constant-one series commutes with coefficient maps
between rational algebras. This allows logarithmic wall labels to specialize
with their wall functions. We use Mathlib's `PowerSeries.map_subst` and `map_log`.
The linear coefficient of a constant-one series agrees with that of its logarithm,
by the logarithmic derivative identity `PowerSeries.logDeriv_mul`.
