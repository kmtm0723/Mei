# Products and powers of left ideals

When the fourth power of a left ideal vanishes, every product of four of its elements
is zero. This allows polynomial identities in such elements to truncate at degree three,
even in a noncommutative semiring. Surjective homomorphisms preserve products and
powers of left ideals, so nilpotency bounds descend to quotient rings. These
statements extend Mathlib's `Ideal.map_mul` and `Ideal.map_pow` beyond commutative
targets, using `Ideal.mem_map_iff_of_surjective`.
