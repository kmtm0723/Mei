# Scalar towers for nodal algebras

The nodal algebra over an algebra `S` is itself an algebra over the original
coefficient semiring `R`. The scoped instances in `Mei.NodeAlgebra` use the
composite scalar map. They allow the chamber maps and incoming lifts to retain
their linear structures over `R` when `S` is a tangential coefficient algebra.
