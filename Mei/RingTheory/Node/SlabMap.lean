# Coefficient change and truncation of slab algebras

Let `R'` be an `R`-algebra, and let `t, f : R` map to `t', f' : R'`. For `k' ≤ k`, the
coefficient map `R[x,y]/(xy-t) → R'[x,y]/(xy-t')` descends to the truncated chambers, the
overlap and the localized overlap of `Mei.NodeAlgebra.slabAlgebra`, from order `k` over `R` to
order `k'` over `R'`. These maps commute with both gluing maps, so they induce a map of slab
algebras `slabAlgebra t f k → slabAlgebra t' f' k'`. It is compatible with the comparison map
from the nodal algebra `R[X,Y]/(XY - tf)`, and hence with `Mei.NodeAlgebra.slabEquiv`.

A change of coefficients `K → K'` and the truncation `K[t]/(t^(k+2)) → K[t]/(t^(k+1))` are both
instances, so the comparison isomorphisms of the truncated slabs commute with both operations.
For the focus-focus slab of Gross–Siebert, *An invitation to toric degenerations*, §2.3,
arXiv:0808.2749v2, see `Mei.FocusFocus.slabAlgebraMap_algebraEquiv`.

## Main definitions

* `Mei.NodeAlgebra.slabAlgebraMap`: the induced map of slab algebras, built from the coefficient
  map `Mei.NodeAlgebra.mapOfEq`.

## Main results

* `Mei.NodeAlgebra.slabAlgebraMap_toSlabAlgebra` and `Mei.NodeAlgebra.slabAlgebraMap_slabEquiv`:
  the slab comparison commutes with coefficient change and truncation.
