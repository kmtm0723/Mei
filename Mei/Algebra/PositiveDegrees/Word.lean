# Bounded words of positive degree changes

A word of allowed nonzero increments has length at most the degree of its sum.
At a fixed degree cutoff there are finitely many such words: every increment
lies in the finite cutoff, and the word length is bounded. For words permitting
zero increments, filtering out zero preserves the sum and leaves at most the
cutoff number of entries. A positive degree map transports the bound through
its cutoff modulus. Thus arbitrary insertions of zero increments do not
enlarge the finite set of reduced degree itineraries. Finite encounter labels
also give finitely many records when each constant-degree block meets each label
at most once: a record has one such block before the first change and after each
change. Encounters acting by the identity on the decoration are retained in these
blocks without being counted as degree changes.

These are the degree-only bounds used for successive homogeneous component
changes. Geometric itineraries additionally carry encounter and chart data.
The increments retain their actual degrees, including nonzero degrees in the
kernel of a geometric projection. No finite generation, saturation, cancellation,
or group hypothesis is needed.
