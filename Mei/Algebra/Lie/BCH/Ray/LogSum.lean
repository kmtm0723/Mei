# Logarithms of completed labels as sums over supported rays

At every order, the logarithm of a completed label is the sum of the logarithms of its ray
factors over any finite set of supported rays containing the rays that meet the cutoff
(`PositiveDegrees.log_projection_eq_sum_log_projection_rayFactor`). Unlike the product formula
`PositiveDegrees.projection_eq_noncommProd_rayFactor`, no commutation of the logarithmic
coefficients is needed: logarithms of ray factors are sums of disjoint sets of homogeneous
coefficients. The proof combines `PositiveDegrees.log_projection_rayFactor` with
`PositiveDegrees.log_projection_eq_mkQ_sum`, using that every nonzero allowed degree lies on
exactly one supported ray.
