# Ray factors under graded maps fixing every degree

A positive degree map `T : d → d` with `T n = n` for every degree may still carry a cutoff
modulus other than the identity, and need not be syntactically `PositiveDegreeMap.id d`; this
happens for degree maps assembled from other data. Completed maps along such a `T` commute with
taking supported-ray factors, as for `PositiveDegreeMap.id d`
(`Mei.GradedLieHom.completedMap_rayFactor`).
