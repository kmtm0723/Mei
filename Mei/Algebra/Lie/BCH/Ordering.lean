# Ordering finite products in completed BCH groups

Let `g : F → G` assign to each factor an element of the completed BCH group of a positively
graded Lie algebra lying in the degree filtration term of order `deg x`. At order `k`,
factors with `deg x > k` project to `1`, and two factors with `deg x + deg y > k` commute
by `commutator_degreeFiltration_le`. So when ordering a finite product at order `k`, only
the bad adjacent pairs with `deg x + deg y ≤ k` need an exchange
`x y = y M x`, and the inserted factors must have larger degree than both.
`PositiveDegrees.exists_isChain_projection_prod_eq_of_exchange` then gives an ordered product
with the same projection, by `List.exists_isChain_prod_map_eq_of_exchange`.

For products of dilogarithm elements `Ψ[n]^c`, with `deg` the degree of `n`, this gives the
termination of Nakanishi's Ordering Algorithm at each finite order once the exchanges of
anti-ordered pairs are supplied, for example by the pentagon relation (Nakanishi, *Cluster
algebras and scattering diagrams, Part III*, §5.2, arXiv:2111.00800v6). Anti-ordered pairs
whose total degree exceeds the order need no exchange.

/-- **Ordering at finite order.** Let each factor `x` lie in the degree filtration of order
`deg x`, and let `bad` be asymmetric. If every bad adjacent pair `x y` with
`deg x + deg y ≤ k` can be exchanged at order `k` as `x y = y M x`, where the factors of
`M` have degree larger than both `deg x` and `deg y`, then every finite product agrees at
order `k` with a product of factors of degree at most `k` with no bad adjacent pair. -/
