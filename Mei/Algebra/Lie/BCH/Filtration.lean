# Commutators in the degree filtration of completed BCH groups

The degree filtration of a completed positively graded BCH group satisfies
`[Fᵃ, Fᵇ] ≤ Fᵃ⁺ᵇ`. Thus an element born in degree `a` commutes with one born
in degree `b` at every order below `a + b`. In particular, the successive
filtration quotients are central, as needed for constructions by degree induction.

In finite Lie quotients, `commute_exp_mk_of_mem_degreeIdeal` says that elements of
`degreeIdeal ℒ a` and `degreeIdeal ℒ b` have commuting exponentials modulo
`degreeIdeal ℒ (a + b + 1)`. This specializes the vanishing-bracket criterion
`BCHGroup.commute_exp_of_lie_eq_zero` using the degree bound
`PositiveDegrees.lie_degreeIdeal_le`. Its completed counterpart,
`commutator_degreeFiltration_le`, bounds commutators at all filtration orders.
The original Lie algebra need not be nilpotent, and no freeness assumption is used.
