# Homogeneous components under regrading

For an additive map preserving homogeneous pieces along an arbitrary map of degrees,
each target component is the sum of the source images over its degree fiber.
The sum uses only the finite homogeneous support of the input, so the degree map need
not have finite fibers or be injective. This describes how coefficients merge under
regrading an internally decomposed additive monoid.

The proof uses Mathlib's `DirectSum.sum_support_decompose` and homogeneous projection API.
