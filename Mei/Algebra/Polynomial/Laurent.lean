# Divisibility of Laurent polynomials by constants

A Laurent polynomial is divisible by a constant `C a` exactly when all of its coefficients are
divisible by `a`, as for `Polynomial.C_dvd_iff_dvd_coeff`. Consequently `1 + T` is a
nonzerodivisor modulo every constant: if `C a` divides `(1 + T) * p`, then it divides `p`.
This is the regularity of a gluing function `1 + w` on truncated Laurent coefficient rings.
