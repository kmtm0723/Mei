# Subdivisions stable under vertex perturbations

A continuous square filling admits a grid subordinate to an open cover, with
one positive perturbation bound for all cells. The same member of the cover
contains the entire original patch and the convex hull of its four perturbed
vertices. This allows subsequent choices of admissible polygonal edges while
retaining local control of the filling.

This extends `ContinuousMap.exists_grid_subdivision` from Tau Ceti. A metric
Lebesgue number and a refinement by smaller balls provide the extra room for
perturbations; convexity of balls controls the resulting polygonal patches.

/-- Subdivide a square filling under an open cover, retaining a uniform positive
margin for perturbing its vertices. For each grid cell, one cover member contains
both its entire image patch and the convex hull of its four perturbed corners.
The grid times start at zero, are monotone, and reach one at the final index. -/
