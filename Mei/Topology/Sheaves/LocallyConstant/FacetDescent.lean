# Facet descent for locally constant sheaves

Let `S` be an open subset of a finite-dimensional real normed space and `F` a sheaf of types
on `S` with bijective restrictions to nonempty preconnected subopens of small neighborhoods.
Consider opens `G ≤ O ≤ U` of `S`: `G` is the union of the top strata, dense in `O`; the points
of `O` outside `G` are the facets; and the points of `U` outside `O` lie in countably many affine
subspaces of codimension at least two. For a locally finite polyhedral stratification, the
codimension-two strata lie in their countably many affine spans.

A section of `F` on the top strata then extends to `U` exactly when it extends across each
facet, that is, to some neighborhood of each facet point. The extension is unique. Across the
facets this is the sheaf gluing of `TopCat.Sheaf.existsUnique_extension_of_subset_closure`.
Across codimension two, small balls stay preconnected after deleting the obstacles, by
`Convex.isPathConnected_diff_of_subset_iUnion`, so sections extend by
`TopCat.Sheaf.map_bijective_of_isPreconnected_inter`.

This is the descent step used to obtain theta functions as global sections from their
chamber values and facet equations; compare Gross–Hacking–Siebert, *Theta functions on
varieties with effective anti-canonical class*, §3.2 (arXiv:1601.07081v4).

/-- **Facet descent.** Let `G ≤ O ≤ U` be opens of an open subset `S` of a finite-dimensional
real normed space, with `G` dense in `O` and the points of `U` outside `O` contained in countably
many affine subspaces of codimension at least two. A section `s` of `F` on `G` extends uniquely to
`U`, provided it extends to a neighborhood of every point of `O` outside `G`.

For a stratification, `G` is the union of the top strata and the points of `O` outside `G` are
the facets; the condition at a facet point says that the continuations of `s` from the two
adjacent chambers agree. -/
