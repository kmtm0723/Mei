# Adjacency of actual connected components

The vertices are Mathlib's connected components of a subset. Two distinct
components are adjacent when their ambient closures share a point of a
specified regular set. A continuous curve leaving the subset only at finitely
many parameters, with regular values at those parameters, gives a finite graph walk.

This criterion turns curves with finitely many crossings into connectivity
results for component adjacency graphs, such as chamber graphs of wall complements.
No local connectedness or separation assumption on the ambient space is needed.
